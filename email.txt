Sure, here's what I've been sending with attachments:

 
Hi NAME,
 
 We reviewed your application & resume and would like to speak with you further regarding the Software Engineer position you applied for here at Deepfield (acquired by Nokia early last year) in Ann Arbor.  Next steps in the application process involve completing a code challenge which I've attached here for you to take a look at and send back once you've had a chance to complete (using Python2, please).  Please keep in mind that we recycle our problems so we ask that you do not make your solution public.

Let me know if you have any questions at all.  Looking forward to hearing from you!
 
Thanks,
 
-- Rachel
